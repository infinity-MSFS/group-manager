## how to use:

press the buttons, make the changes, updated_groups.json will be generated, just copy the ENTIRE document and replace ALL OF THE CONTENTS groups.json in your local repo. (the one that got created from `git clone https://github.com/infinity-MSFS/groups.git` ) then push your changes, wait like 30 secs between changes because sometimes github raw is shit. ill make the app more idiot proof later but i trust we are smart enough not to break everything RIGHT?
